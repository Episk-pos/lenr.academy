● Test Coverage Review Complete

I've completed a comprehensive review of the test coverage for the decay chain visualization feature (PR #67). Here's the summary:

📊 Current Status: INSUFFICIENT TEST COVERAGE

Findings:

✅ Existing Coverage (Pre-PR):
- Basic decay data display, badges, and navigation
- Decay table toggle functionality
- Mobile responsiveness
- Half-life unit display

❌ Missing Coverage (New in PR #67):
- Zero tests for DecayChainDiagram.tsx component
- Zero tests for zoom/pan controls
- Zero tests for mutually exclusive row expansion
- Zero tests for table height auto-adjustment
- Zero tests for Integrated tab decay chain section

📝 Report Generated

I've created TEST_COVERAGE_REPORT.md with:

1. Detailed gap analysis - What's tested vs. what's missing
2. Complete test suite - 7 test groups with ~25 test cases
3. Ready-to-use code - Copy-paste Playwright tests
4. Test data recommendations - Specific nuclides to use (U-238, Th-232, C-14, etc.)
5. Execution plan - Prioritized in 3 phases

🎯 Recommended Action

Before merging to production, implement Phase 1 Critical Tests (~3-4 hours):

1. DecayChainDiagram rendering for U-238
2. Zoom controls functionality
3. Mutually exclusive row expansion
4. Table height auto-adjustment
5. Integrated tab decay chain section

All test code is provided in the report - you can copy it directly into a new file e2e/tests/decay-chain.spec.ts.

📁 Files to Review

- TEST_COVERAGE_REPORT.md - Complete analysis and test suite
- Current E2E tests: e2e/tests/element-data.spec.ts (for reference patterns)

Would you like me to:
1. Create the new test file with Phase 1 critical tests?
2. Run the existing E2E suite to establish a baseline?
3. Both?
