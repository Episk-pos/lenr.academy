        ## Automated Error Report

        This template is designed for errors reported through LENR Academy's built-in error reporting system.

        **If you clicked "Report This Error" in the app:**
        1. ‚úÖ Paste the error details from your clipboard below in the "Error Report" field
        2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** After pasting, scroll down and fill in the **Steps to Reproduce**, **Expected Behavior**, and **Actual Behavior** sections
        3. üîç These details are critical for developers to understand and fix the issue quickly

        **If you're manually creating this report:** Please use the [Bug Report](https://github.com/Episk-pos/lenr.academy/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) template instead, which provides structured fields for manual entry.

  - type: textarea
    id: error-report

        **Step 1:** Paste the complete error report that was copied to your clipboard when you clicked "Report This Error".

        The report includes technical details like:
        - Error fingerprint (for searching/grouping similar errors)
        - Error type and message
        - Stack trace
        - Browser/OS/device information
        - URL and timestamp

        **Step 2 (CRITICAL):** After pasting, you MUST scroll through the pasted report and fill in these sections:
        - **Steps to Reproduce** - Exact steps that led to this error
        - **Expected Behavior** - What you expected to happen
        - **Actual Behavior** - What actually happened

        Without these details, developers cannot reliably reproduce and fix the issue.
